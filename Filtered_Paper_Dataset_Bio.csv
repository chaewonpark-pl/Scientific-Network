However, its effects on the mechanism of human mast cell line (HMC)-1-mediated inflammation remained unknown.   MATERIALS AND METHODS To provide insight into the biological effects of sinomenine, we examined its influence on the pro-inflammatory cytokine production in HMC-1 cells stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) plus A23187 by evaluating the stimulated cells in the presence or absence of sinomenine. In the present study, the pro-inflammatory cytokine production was measured using ELISA, Reverse Transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathway activation, as determined by Western blot analysis. Also, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression was measured through Western blot and RT-PCR analysis.   RESULTS Sinomenine inhibited the pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by PMA plus A23187 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, sinomenine inhibited the phosphorylations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 MAPKs as well as the translocation of NF-kappaB p65 through reduced IkappaBalpha degradation. In addition, sinomenine suppressed COX-2 protein and mRNA expression dose-dependently.   CONCLUSIONS Taken together, the results of this study indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of sinomenine may occur via the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine and COX-2 production through the inhibition of MAPKs and NF-kappaB pathway activation by PMA plus A23187 stimulation in HMC-1 cells.",50,"국립원예특작과학원, 한국한의학연구원, 원광대학",National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science; Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine; Wonkwang University,"국립원예특작과학원, 한국한의학연구원, 원광대학",국립원예특작과학원; 한국한의학연구원; 원광대학,Y.

Although some genetic evidence has indicated that autophagy has as a tumor suppressor function, it also provides some advantages to tumors under metabolic stress conditions. Autophagy is regulated by several autophagy-related gene (ATG) proteins. In mammals, 16 different ATG genes have been identified. To investigate the clinicopathological role of ATG5 in colorectal cancer, we firstly investigated its expression in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer. Expression analysis revealed ATG5 to be strongly down-regulated in colorectal cancer (38/40 patients). Interestingly, immunohistochemical analysis of colorectal cancer tissues indicated that increased ATG5 expression is associated with lymphovascular invasion (p=0.035). The findings in our limited clinical cohort indicate that ATG5 could be a potential prognostic or diagnostic biomarker.",50,"서울아산병원, 울산대학, 경희대학",Asan Medical Center; University of Ulsan College of Medicine; Kyung Hee University,"서울아산병원, 울산대학, 경희대학",서울아산병원; 울산대학; 경희대학,D.

BACKGROUND No sufficient in vivo data exist regarding microvessel characteristics in ISR lesions.   METHODS Among 78 ISR lesions (drug-eluting stent, n = 72; bare-metal stent, n = 6) in our OCT registry database, visible microvessels were detected in 21 (27%). Microvessels were defined as low backscattering structures <200 횓쩌m in diameter on OCT. Clinical, angiographic, and OCT findings were compared between lesions with and without microvessels.   RESULTS Lesions with microvessels had a larger reference vessel diameter (2.90 횂짹 0.47 mm vs 2.58 횂짹 0.42 mm; P=.009) and post-stent minimum lumen diameter (2.76 횂짹 0.29 mm vs 2.54 횂짹 0.39 mm; P=.033) than those without microvessels. From OCT findings at the segment with minimal lumen cross-sectional area (CSA), neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) CSA (5.4 횂짹 1.7 mm횂짼 vs 4.2 횂짹 2.1 mm횂짼; P=.024) and percent NIH CSA (NIH CSA x 100/stent CSA) were significantly greater in lesions with microvessels (79 횂짹 12% vs 67 횂짹 16%; P=.001). On multivariate analysis, reference vessel diameter (odds ratio [OR], 4.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-20.4; P=.043) and percent NIH CSA at the segment with minimal lumen CSA (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P=.021) were independent predictors of microvessels. From receiver operating characteristic analysis, the cut-off values of reference vessel diameter and percent NIH CSA predicting the presence of microvessels were 3.1 mm and 74%, respectively.   CONCLUSIONS Visible microvessels in ISR lesions might be associated with increased vessel size and extent of NIH.",100,"연세대학세브란스심장혈관병원, 연세대학",Severance Cardiovascular Hospital; Yonsei University College of Medicine,"연세대학세브란스심장혈관병원, 연세대학",연세대학; 연세대학,Byeong-Keuk Kim; Jung-Sun Kim; D.

Loose Plant Architecture1 (LPA1) in rice (Oryza sativa) and its Arabidopsis homologues (SGR5/AtIDD15) have been reported to control plant architecture and auxin homeostasis. This study explores the role of LPA1 in determining lamina inclination in rice. LPA1 acts as a positive regulator to suppress lamina bending. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that LPA1 suppresses the auxin signalling that interacts with C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs, which regulates lamina inclination independently of OsBRI1. Mutant lpa1 plants are hypersensitive to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) during the lamina inclination response, which is suppressed by the brassinazole (Brz) inhibitor of C-22 hydroxylase involved in BR synthesis. A strong synergic effect is detected between lpa1 and d2 (the defective mutant for catalysis of C-23-hydroxylated BRs) during IAA-mediated lamina inclination. No significant interaction between LPA1 and OsBRI1 was identified. The lpa1 mutant is sensitive to C-22-hydroxylated and 6-deoxo BRs in the d61-1 (rice BRI1 mutant) background. We present evidence verifying that two independent pathways function via either BRs or BRI1 to determine IAA-mediated lamina inclination in rice. RNA sequencing analysis and qRT-PCR indicate that LPA1 influences the expression of three OsPIN genes (OsPIN1a, OsPIN1c and OsPIN3a), which suggests that auxin flux might be an important factor in LPA1-mediated lamina inclination in rice.",100,"riken지속가능한자원과학센터, 농촌진흥청, 원광대학, 경상대학, 조에츠교육대학, 심양농업대학, 경희대학",RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science; Rural Development Administration; Wonkwang University; Gyeongsang National University; Joetsu University of Education; Shenyang Agricultural University; Kyung Hee University,"RIKEN지속가능한자원과학센터, 농촌진흥청, 원광대학, 경상대학, 조에츠교육대학, 심양농업대학, 경희대학",RIKEN지속가능한자원과학센터; 농촌진흥청; 원광대학; 경상대학; 조에츠교육대학; 심양농업대학; 경희대학,Jing Miao Liu; Soon Ju Park; Jin Huang; Eun Jin Lee; Yuan Hu Xuan; Byoung Il Je; Vikranth Kumar; Ryza A.

For the proposed novel method named as Wire-Network Molding, firstly, we prepare a mold with designed shape. Secondly, rectangular wires with thickness size 300 μm, 400 μm or 620 μm are inserted to make space for interconnected pore. After that, melted PCL (polycaprolactone) which is one of synthetic polymers with biocompatibility is filled in the mold and the mold is cooled at room temperature. Subsequently, wires are separated from the mold and the mold is removed from PCL. Consequently, the remained PCL has interconnected pores with a configuration of wire-network. To analyze the compressive modulus of the fabricated scaffold, UTM compression test is carried out. Moreover, we compare the compressive modulus of the fabricated scaffold with that of bio-plotter scaffold. Additionally, for scaffolds with 300 μm, 400 μm pore size, cell culture experiments are carried out using human Mesenchymal stem cell and cell-cultural characteristics are assessed compared with particulate-leaching scaffold.",100,원광대학,Wonkwang University,원광대학,원광대학,C.H.

Electrical detection methods of DNA synthesis are based on these H+ kinetic mechanisms. The detection method that uses ISFET, which is related to the surface trapping mechanism, showed a better sensing signal than the induced charge detection method, which is related to the diffusion of H+ into the surrounding solution. The trapping reaction should be well-controlled, however, so that it would be stable under various surface conditions and temperatures. Moreover, the reaction should be reversible, and the reaction parameters should be well-sustained in the subsequent synthesis cycles. For the induced charge method, the AC current level was too small to be detected using an ordinary amplifier circuit with the same sensor size as that of ISFET. Consequently, the sensor operation sustainability and signal-to-noise ratio characteristics should be addressed carefully in the selection of the proper sensor type.",50,서울대학,Seoul National University,서울대학,서울대학,Jinhong Ahn; S.

Thiol-modified GF–CTP electrodes were prepared using amine crosslinking chemistry and AuNPs were self-assembled obtaining highly conductive nanoelectrodes, GF–CTP–ATP–Au. All steps of electrode modifications were characterized using electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic methods. GF–CTP–ATP–Au electrode was then modified with a capture DNA probe (C-ssDNA) and optimized with a target DNA probe in terms of hybridization time and temperature between 30 and 180 min and 20–50 °C, respectively. Finally, the analytic performance of the developed ssDNA biosensor was evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The calibration of the sensor was obtained between 0.1 pM and 10 nM analyte working range. The limit of detection was calculated using signal to noise ratio of 3 (S/N = 3) as 13 fM. Moreover, interference results for two noncomplementary DNA probes were also tested to demonstrate non-specific ssDNA interactions. An electrochemical label-free DNA impedimetric sensor was successfully developed using a novel GF–CTP–ATP–Au electrode.

METHODOLOGY Twenty rats were continuously infused with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) for tumor induction. After 32 to 36 weeks of DEN treatment, the rats underwent MRI of the liver with a 3-T MR imaging system. Perfusion parametric maps and perfusion parameters such as, time to peak (TTP) and peak enhancement (PE) were obtained by using a commercially available software package. The nodules were correlated precisely to DCE MR images.   RESULTS A total of 13 nodules were found in 12 rats; 5 dysplastic nodule (DN)s were identified in 5 rats and 8 HCCs (3 Edmonson grade I, 2 Edmonson grade I-II, 3 Edmonson grade II) were found in 7 rats. There were significant differences in mean values of PE and HPH (histogram peak height) of PE between DN and HCC. Mean value and HPH of PE showed statistically significant correlation with tumor grade.   CONCLUSIONS There were significant differences in perfusion parameters between DN and HCC.

A rectangular BSA, which is the most generally used, produces a penumbra region at the edge of the grid on the projection image. The penumbra region can be the cause of an inaccurate scatter estimate and loss of image data. In this study, two types of BSAs have been designed and developed, a linear BSA (l-BSA), which is a simple rectangular type, and a curved BSA (c-BSA) to avoid the penumbra effect. A Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the thickness and the material of beam stop arrays. The particle tracking technique of MCNP5 code was used to analyze the accuracy of the scatter distribution acquired by the beam stop arrays. The improvement in the image quality was analyzed by using an in-house phantom, a simple type CT phantom, and a humanoid phantom. How the curved beam stop array improved the penumbra effect was also analyzed in a large field of view. The additional dose caused by a dual scan was analyzed by using a Monte Carlo simulation and experiment. The accuracies of the scatter estimates were 83.4% for the c-BSA and 90.4% for the l-BSA. The c-BSA compensated the penumbra effect effectively while the l-BSA had a severe penumbra region in the partial projection image in a large field of view. Contrasts were improved by 24.8 (air-PMMA), 55.8 (Teflon-PMMA), and 81.7% (water-PMMA) for the c-BSA and 11.1 (air-PMMA), 44.1 (Teflon-PMMA), and 82.2% (water-PMMA) for the l-BSA by scatter correction. After noise suppression, the contrast-to-noise ratios were improved by 2.7'.1 times for the c-BSA and 3.5'.3 times for the l-BSA. Uniformities were also improved by up to 10 times for the c-BSA and 12 times for the l-BSA. The quality of the humanoid phantom image was also improved after the scatter correction. Consequently, the c-BSA can improve the image quality of cone-beam CT and compensate for the penumbra effect without an additional dose of radiation.",50,"가천대학, 이화여자대학, 버지니아커먼웰스대학의료시스템, 이화여자대학",Gachon University; Ewha Womans University School of Medicine; Virginia Commonwealth University Health System; Ewha Womans University,"가천대학, 이화여자대학, 버지니아커먼웰스대학의료시스템, 이화여자대학",가천대학; 이화여자대학; 버지니아커먼웰스대학의료시스템; 이화여자대학,Sohyun Ahn; Jinho Choi; Kyu Chan Lee; Siyong Kim; Rena Lee,"['sohyunahn', 'jinhochoi', 'kyuchanlee', 'siyongkim', 'renalee']",5,2,0.142857143,54,18,0,2,2,1090000000,750000000,2010-04-01,2014-07-31,1582,9,7,2,3,4,"이화여자대학, 오스템임플란트","[4, 1]",2,1,0,0,1,0,0,0.5,0.145813292,0.403141534,0.916666667,0.607142857,0.666666667,0.755102041,0.244897959,0.00101626,7,3.5,0.354541003,0.001143385,0.001656497,0.002323214,0.012332478,9,9,0,12,5,7,8,2,6,4,3,1,21,1,1,3,3,0.40600585,0,0

The kinetic analysis of the upper extremities during manual wheelchair propulsion in various conditions needed to be investigated. We developed and calibrated a wheelchair dynamometer for measuring kinetic parameters during propulsion. We utilized the dynamometer to investigate and compare the propulsion torque and power values of experienced and novice users under four different conditions. Experienced wheelchair users generated lower torques with more power than novice users and reacted alertly and sensitively to changing conditions. We expect that these basic methods and results may help to quantitatively evaluate the mechanical efficiency of manual wheelchair propulsion.,50,연세대학미래캠퍼스,Yonsei University Mirae Campus,연세대학미래캠퍼스,연세대학,Seonhong Hwang; Seunghyeon Kim; Jongsang Son; Youngho Kim,"['seonhonghwang', 'seunghyeonkim', 'jongsangson', 'younghokim']",4,0,0.215789474,82,82,1,1,1,1529800000,1090000000,2008-12-01,2013-09-30,1764,45,7,2,3,7,"근로복지공단재활공학연구소, 코모텍, 코캄, 고려대학, 동국대학, 상윤산업, 연세대학, 이모션텍","[6, 3, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3]",8,0,0,4,3,0,1,0.59375,0.473015873,0.361111111,0.5,0.333333333,0,0.407122032,0.592877968,0.02731764,188,23.5,0.410101231,0.001143385,0.001656497,0.002323214,0.00240475,3,3,0,6,4,2,6,4,2,0,0,0,9,1,1,5,2,0.181435907,0,0

The efficient selection method was made possible by the adoption of the Folin-Ciocalteu (FC) colorimetric method for qualitative detection of the polyphenols. The polyphenol composition varied widely among the randomly sampled 160 tea tree lines. The tea tree lines were classified into three groups on the basis of color intensity obtained after treatment of tea extracts with FC reagent. The polyphenol content of the three groups was quantified and validated by UV spectrophotometric analysis. Among various tea lines, H-23 tea line exhibited the highest amounts of polyphenol that was 2.89-fold higher than those found in low polyphenol producing tea tree (H-9). Hence FC colorimetric method can become a reliable selection method for easy and rapid selection of tea population rich in polyphenol in a tea tree breeding programme.",50,"하동녹차연구소, 경상대학, 충남대학, 큐슈대학, 방갈로르대학, 산청한방약초연구소",Hadong Green Tea Institute; Gyeongsang National University; Chungnam National University; Kyushu University; Bangalore University; Sancheong Oriental Medicinal Herb Institute,"하동녹차연구소, 경상대학, 충남대학, 큐슈대학, 방갈로르대학, 산청한방약초연구소",하동녹차연구소; 경상대학; 충남대학; 큐슈대학; 방갈로르대학; 산청한방약초연구소,C.

The filtering methods include software, hardware, and hybrid correction methods. In the software correction method, PET signals are assessed, and valid signals are identified based on the characteristics of a typical PET signal using Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-based programming. The hardware correction method makes use of differential-to-single-ended and low-pass filter circuits for PET analog signals. The hybrid correction method involves the sequential application of both the hardware and software methods. Both valid and contaminated PET signals are measured with an oscilloscope. An evaluation is then made of the performance (energy resolution, photopeak channel, total counts, and coincidence timing resolution) of the PET detector modules with and without various MR sequences (gradient echo, spin echo T1 sequence). For all correction methods, the energy resolution, photopeak position, and coincidence timing resolution with MR sequences are similar (<; 3%) to those without MR sequences. However, the total count of each module depends greatly on the method applied. The hybrid correction method displays an ability to preserve (<; 1%) the total counts of the modules during various MR sequences. The results show that this filtering method, which can reject noise signals and reduce count loss while preserving the valid analog signals of MR sequences, is reliable and useful for the development of simultaneous PET-MRI.",33.33333333,"스탠포드대학, 한국과학기술원, 서강대학, 성균관대학삼성서울병원",Stanford University School of Medicine; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; Sogang University; Sungkyunkwan University,"스탠포드대학, 한국과학기술원, 서강대학, 성균관대학삼성서울병원",스탠포드대학; 한국과학기술원; 서강대학; 성균관대학,Y.

We evaluated through a simulated electrocardiogram (ECG) the administration of a contrast with high relaxivity and its effect on the heart rate by using a modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI) pulse sequence. The agarose 2% phantom of high relaxivity environment was developed by diluting gadoxetic acid magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1 contrast media. The gold standard T1 determination was based on coronal single section imaging with a 2D inversion-recovery turbo spin echo sequence (2D-IRTSE) in a 3T MR unit. Using the identical 3T MR scanner, we acquired T1 mapping for the MOLLI pulse sequence with various virtual heart rates. T1 mapping data of the two different pulse sequences (i.e., 2D-IRTSE and MOLLI) were measured to investigate the accuracy and the specificity. An in vivo study was conducted in the same manner as the phantom experiments for liver T1 mapping imaging in three healthy volunteers. The MOLLI pulse sequence showed an error rate of less than 10% at a contrast agent concentration of 0.4 mmol/L, and significant error, compared with the reference value, was observed at 0.6 mmol/L or higher. The percentage error of the T1 value did not correlated with the RR (i.e., the time between heart beats) change that was observed (P =.270). Based on the in-vivo liver test, T1 mapping imaging of an abdominal organ as the liver can be successfully achieved using the applied virtual ECG gating on the MOLLI sequence.",33.33333333,"청주대학, 가톨릭대학, 김천대학","Cheongju University; The Catholic University of Korea, College of Medicine; Gimcheon University","청주대학, 가톨릭대학, 김천대학",청주대학; 가톨릭대학; 김천대학,Seung-Man Yu; E.

However, the underlying mechanism of spinal pain generation by epidural adhesion has not yet been elucidated.   OBJECTIVES To elucidate the underlying mechanism of spinal pain generation by epidural adhesion using a two-dimensional (2D) non-linear finite element (FE) analysis.   STUDY DESIGN A finite element analysis.   SETTING A two-dimensional nonlinear FE model of the herniated lumbar disc on L4/5 with epidural adhesion.   METHODS A two-dimensional nonlinear FE model of the lumbar spine was developed, consisting of intervertebral discs, dura, spinal nerve, and lamina. The annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulpous were modeled as hyperelastic using the Mooney-Rivlin equation. The FE mesh was generated and analyzed using Abaqus (ABAQUS 6.13.; Hibbitt, Karlsson & Sorenson, Inc., Providence, RI, USA). Epidural adhesion was simulated as rough contact, in which no slip occurred once two surfaces were in contact, between the dura mater and posterior annulus fibrosus.   RESULTS The FE model of adhesion showed significant stress concentration in the spinal nerves, especially on the dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The stress concentration was caused by the lack of adaptive displacement between the dura mater and posterior annulus fibrosus. The peak von Mises stress was higher in the epidural adhesion model (Adhesion, 0.67 vs. Control, 0.46). In the control model, adaptive displacement was observed with decreased stress in the spinal nerve and DRG (with adhesion, 2.59 vs. without adhesion, 3.58, P < 0.00).   LIMITATIONS This study used a 2D non-linear FE model, which simplifies the 3D nature of the human intervertebral disc. In addition, this 2D non-linear FE model has not yet been validated.   CONCLUSION The current study clearly demonstrated that epidural adhesion causes significantly increased stress in the spinal nerves, especially at the DRG. We believe that the increased stress on the spinal nerve might elicit more pain under similar magnitudes of lumbar disc protrusion.",100,"연세대학, 구로튼튼병원",Yonsei University College of Medicine; Guro Teun Teun Hospital,"연세대학, 구로튼튼병원",연세대학; 구로튼튼병원,Nam Lee; Gyu Yeul Ji; S.

Water extracts of these seaweeds generally showed low anti-germination activities than methanol extracts. Of the nine water extracts, Enteromorpha linza extract completely inhibited L. sativa germination at 16 mg/filter paper after 24 hrs. To identify the primary active compounds, C. fulvescens. powder was successively fractionated according to polarity, and the main active agents against L. sativa were determined to be lipids (0.0% germination at 0.5 mg of lipids/paper disc).

However, due to the complexity of the device' geometry and the transparency of the device' material, measuring the complete thickness profile has been difficult.

A mixture of the fluid in a microfluidic channel is frequently achieved by using some special structure such as grooves or form by inducing a high rate flow that results in a high Reynold number (over 24943 '2000). However, these methods are accompanied by a complicated procedure like lithography or a special attachment protocol between PDMS and glass. In this study, we introduce a PDMS-based screw-wall microfluidic channel (SMC) as a functionalized channel. The SMC can be developed using a simple protocol and skipping some complicated procedures. Nevertheless, a turbulent flow showing the same mixing performance at low flow rate can be formed. The turbulent flow in the SMC is supported by a computational simulation and is observed by using a mixture of red ink and blue ink under a microscope. Furthermore, its effectiveness for commercial application is confirmed with the synthesis of nanoparticles. The dispersion coefficient (DR) is suggested in a computational simulation and is calculated for three different ratios of the screw thread diameter to the pipe line diameter. This shows that the more effective the mixture by turbulent flow in the SMC is, the nearer to 1 the ratio is. In experiments, a comparison study of a SMC and a plain wall microchannel shows clear differences in the mixtures performance. Finally, nanoparticles are synthesized for 5 different SMCs with pipe line diameters of 120, 170, 200, 500, and 1000 um and a single-peaked distribution for the sizes of the nanoparticles is observed when a 120 um SMC is applied. These results prove that the SMC developed by using our suggesting simple protocol can form a turbulent flow at low flow rate and is good enough to be used as a mixer.",100,한국산업기술시험원,Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology; Korea Testing Laboratory,한국산업기술시험원,한국산업기술시험원,Jun-Min Kim; Jaekwan Lim; Tae-Rin Lee; Sangyoon Park,"['junminkim', 'jaekwanlim', 'taerinlee', 'sangyoonpark']",4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1185700000,780000000,2015-06-01,2020-05-31,1826,8,7,2,3,7,"서울대학, 미루시스템즈, 큐브인스트루먼트, 메디허브","[4, 3, 3, 3]",4,0,0,3,1,0,0,0.375,,,1,1,1,0.959957742,0.040042258,0.016361967,196,49,0.466436077,0.000496698,0.000639182,0.001066048,0.001999592,1,1,0,7,6,1,7,6,1,0,0,0,8,1,1,4,0,0,0,0

Innate tumor resistance and presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) require the development of multi-modal therapeutic regimens. Previously, cytosine deaminase (CD)-expressing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC/CD) were found to exhibit anticancer activity with a wide therapeutic index by converting 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), a nontoxic prodrug into 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a potent anticancer drug. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of MSC/CD in a multi-modal combination regimen with temozolomide (TMZ). Cell viability test, cell cycle, and normalized isobologram analyses were performed. In vivo anticancer effects were tested in a mouse orthotopic glioma model. TMZ and MSC/CD with 5-FC synergistically interacted and suppressed U87 glioma cell line growth in vitro. Combined treatment with TMZ and 5-FU increased cell cycle arrest and DNA breakage. In an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, treatment with TMZ alone suppressed tumor growth; however, this effect was more intense with MSC/CD transplantation followed by the sequential treatment with 5-FC and TMZ. Therefore, we propose that sequential treatment with 5-FC and MSC/CD can be used in patients with GBM during the immediate postoperative period to sensitize tumors to subsequent adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy.",100,"아주대학, 아주대학의학전문대학원, 웨이크포레스트대학, 서울대학",Ajou University School of Medicine; Ajou University Graduate School of Medicine; Wake Forest University; Seoul National University College of Medicine,"아주대학, 아주대학의학전문대학원, 웨이크포레스트대학, 서울대학",아주대학; 아주대학의학전문대학원; 웨이크포레스트대학; 서울대학,Da-Young Chang; Jin-Hwa Jung; A.

In allergic reactions, mast cells induce a hypersensitive immune response to a substance that is normally harmless. Ionizing radiation has different biological effects depending on the dose and dose rate. In this study, we investigated whether low-dose irradiation before (preventative effect) or after (therapeutic effect) an antigenantibody reaction has an anti-allergic effect. To test this, we activated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells with anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE (antibody) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl human serum albumin, which served as an antigen. To test for both the potential of a preventative effect and a therapeutic effect, we irradiated mast cells both before and after mast cell activation, and we measured mediator release and signaling pathway activity. Low-dose ionizing radiation suppressed mediator release from RBL-2H3 mast cells activated by the antigen-antibody reaction regardless of when the mast cells were irradiated. These results were due to the suppression of FcεRI expression. Therefore, we suggest that low-dose ionizing radiation has a preventative and therapeutic effect in allergic reactions via the fcεRI-mediated RBL-2H3 mast cell activation system.",100,한국수력원자력,"Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co., Ltd.",한국수력원자력,한국수력원자력,Joo; Hong; Seong-Jun Cho; S.

However, responses to immunotherapy did not always occur or last long., i.e. primary or acquired resistance, even tumors were PD-L1 positive. Several oncogenic pathways, including PI3K/AKT activation by PTEN loss and NF-횓쨘B activation, induce PD-L1 expression and PD-L1 inhibitor-resistance. They also induce expression of CCL2, an inhibitory chemokine that blocks T cell tracking into the tumor by binding to CCR2 on the T cell surface. In this study, we showed that transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a post-translational modification enzyme, induced ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation of tumor suppressors including PTEN and I횓쨘B횓짹 by peptide cross-linking, inducing CCL2 as well as PD-L1 expression via PI3K/AKT and NF-횓쨘B activation. It also induced PD-L1 inhibitor-resistance because CCL2 was expressed despite increased PD-L1, which was blocked by PD-L1 inhibitor. We also revealed that inhibition of TG2, instead of PD-L1, restored T cell-dependent killing effect by blocking expression of both PD-L1 and CCL2 in PD-L1(+) triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. In addition, the TG2-expressing TNBC patient group showed higher PD-L1 expression incidence than did the TG2-negative TNBC patient group. In conclusion, TG2 induces primary PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-resistance by inducing CCL2 expression. TG2 blockade can be utilized as an excellent therapeutic strategy to overcome PD-L1 inhibitor-resistance in PD-L1(+) TNBC patients. Our study suggested that PD-L1 expression alone might not always be a predictive biomarker for PD-L1(+) TNBC, but TG2 could be a useful predictive marker to select PD-L1 inhibitor-resistant TNBC patients.",50,"서울아산병원, 울산대학, 한국화학연구원krict, 중앙대학, 국립암센터",Asan Medical Center; University of Ulsan College of Medicine; Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT); Chung-Ang University College of Medicine; National Cancer Center,"서울아산병원, 울산대학, 한국화학연구원(KRICT), 중앙대학, 국립암센터",서울아산병원; 울산대학; 한국화학연구원; 중앙대학; 국립암센터,Junyoung Choi; H.

Metal-oxide-semiconductor capacitors were fabricated on 4H-silicon carbide substrates and the capacitance-voltage properties were measured. The high-low capacitance-voltage method was used to obtain the interface trap density from the capacitance-voltage curve. Boron passivation is known to be effective in reducing the size of carbon clusters at the silicon-carbide/silicon-dioxide interface. Also re-oxidation is known to be effective in improving the quality of the oxide and reducing the dangling bond set of the silicon-carbide/silicon-dioxide interface. The effect of each boron passivation and re-oxidation method on the silicon carbide/silicon dioxide interface was analyzed by observing the interface trap density obtained from the capacitance-voltage curves. We found that the interface trap density could be significantly improved; the best sample exhibited an interface trap density approximately 51% lower than that of the sample subjected to conventional oxidation via wet oxidation, boron passivation and wet re-oxidation. The interface of each sample was investigated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, based on which we inferred that boron-passivation reduced the size of residue carbon clusters located at the silicon-carbide/silicon-dioxide interface.",50,서강대학,Sogang University,서강대학,서강대학,Chungbu Jeong; Kwangsoo Kim,"['chungbujeong', 'kwangsookim']",2,0,0.043010753,20,20,0,0,1,530000000,290000000,2019-03-01,2020-02-28,364,10,7,2,3,7,"서강대학, 우진엔텍, 퓨쳐켐, 씨에스캠, 아스텔","[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]",5,0,0,4,1,0,0,0.32,0.333333333,1,0,0,0,0.660493827,0.339506173,0.003147954,36,7.2,0.421656839,0.000568799,0.000749399,0.001353861,0.01114475,2,0,2,6,6,0,4,4,0,2,2,0,8,,1,1,2,0.735758882,0,0

To characterize MSCs from different sources, we compared human bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue (AT), and umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs (UCB-MSCs) for surface antigen expression, differentiation ability, proliferation capacity, clonality, tolerance for aging, and paracrine activity. Although MSCs from different tissues have similar levels of surface antigen expression, immunosuppressive activity, and differentiation ability, UCB-MSCs had the highest rate of cell proliferation and clonality, and significantly lower expression of p53, p21, and p16, well known markers of senescence. Since paracrine action is the main action of MSCs, we examined the anti-inflammatory activity of each MSC under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation. Co-culture of UCB-MSCs with LPS-treated rat alveolar macrophage, reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-6, and IL-8 via angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). Using recombinant Ang-1 as potential soluble paracrine OPEN ACCESS Int. 17987 factor or its small interference RNA (siRNA), we found that Ang-1 secretion was responsible for this beneficial effect in part by preventing inflammation. Our results demonstrate that primitive UCB-MSCs have biological advantages in comparison to adult sources, making UCB-MSCs a useful model for clinical applications of cell therapy.",100,"메디포스트, 울산대학","MEDIPOST Co., Ltd.; University of Ulsan College of Medicine","메디포스트, 울산대학",메디포스트; 울산대학,H.

In this study, the hydrocolloid patch including poorly soluble drugs such as genistein and daidzein was used as the transdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) to deliver them through the skin. It was confirmed that the patches are helpful for the drugs to be absorb much and more deeply than the cream due to the occlusive effect of patch, which was verified from the porcine skin and the confocal microscopy.

Because the etiology of MMD is unknown, its diagnosis is based on characteristic angiographic findings. Re-vascularization techniques (e.g., bypass surgery) are used to restore perfusion, and are the primary treatment for MMD. There is no specific treatment to prevent MMD progression. This review summarizes the recent advances in MMD pathophysiology, including the genetic and circulating factors related to disease development. Genetic and environmental factors may play important roles in the development of the vascular stenosis and aberrant angiogenesis in complex ways. These factors include the related changes in circulating endothelial/smooth muscle progenitor cells, cytokines related to vascular remodeling and angiogenesis, and endothelium, such as caveolin which is a plasma membrane protein. With a better understanding of MMD pathophysiology, nonsurgical approaches targeting MMD pathogenesis may be available to stop or slow the progression of this disease. The possible strategies include targeting growth factors, retinoic acid, caveolin-1, and stem cells.",100,"universityoftokyo, 서울대학어린이병원, 성균관대학삼성서울병원, 성균관대학삼성서울병원","Graduate School of Medicine; Seoul National University Children's Hospital; Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan university; SKKU School of Medicine","University of Tokyo, 서울대학어린이병원, 성균관대학삼성서울병원, 성균관대학삼성서울병원",University of Tokyo; 서울대학; 성균관대학; 성균관대학,O.

CXCR7 was up-regulated in BM-MSCs harvested at a high density (~90% confluent) in comparison to BM-MSCs harvested at a low density (~50% confluent). Furthermore, following their injection, high-density MSCs expressing CXCR7 were found in small intestinal tissues of graft-versus-host disease mice. In addition, MSCs derived from three different umbilical cord blood samples highly expressed CXCR7 in high-density culture.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the optimal acquisition conditions for the diagnosis of dental caries and to evaluate the image performance of the new intraoral x-ray imaging system. The 33 model sets were made with 3 teeth were randomly selected from 99 extracted human teeth, total of 5 conventional radiographic sets as control groups and 1 experimental set were prepared after cavity forming the 4 sites of artificial proximal caries(grade 1 to 4).

In previous research, we have tried to compare the performances of different coil elements and array geometries for a pTx body image. Based on these results, we attempt to obtain a human image with the proposed pTx array. Through the simulation and experimental results, we introduce a possible structure of multi-channel Tx array and verify the utility of a multi-channel Tx body image using B1 + shimming. The insertional pTx array, combined with a receiver (Rx) array coil, provides an enhanced B1 + field homogeneity in a large ROI image as a result of B1 + shimming applied over the full body size object. Through this research, we hope to determine the usefulness of the proposed insertional type RF coil combination for 3 T body imaging.",50,가천대학,Gachon University,가천대학,가천대학,Y.

The DRF-GRAPPA combines multichannel images by separately obtaining magnitude information and phase information. The method is applied to parallel MRI to reconstruct an image from under-sampled k-space data by using a direct reconstruction filter that can simultaneously estimate full k-space signals and combine multi-channel images. To obtain both magnitude and phase information, the DRF-GRAPPA provides two different direct reconstruction filters. The accuracy of the magnitude and phase information is validated through simulations. In addition, the experiment results of spherical water phantom imaging and in-vivo imaging demonstrate that the DRF-GRAPPA can successfully reconstruct images with both magnitude and phase information within a reduced reconstruction time.",50,"가천대학, 한국과학기술원",Gachon University; Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology,"가천대학, 한국과학기술원",가천대학; 한국과학기술원,Dongchan Kim; Sungwon Jung; Hyunwoo Park,"['dongchankim', 'sungwonjung', 'hyunwoopark']",3,0,0.144736842,77,38.5,0,2,2,670000000,670000000,2016-08-04,2022-03-03,2037,10,5,2,1,4,"길의료재단, 옴니씨앤에스, 가천대학, 연세대학","[6, 3, 4, 4]",4,0,0,1,2,0,1,0.625,,,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.592341311,0.407658689,0.012354955,148,37,0.458852071,0.000496698,0.000639182,0.001066048,0.002569891,1,1,0,5,4,1,3,2,1,2,2,0,6,1,2,3,1,0.301194212,0,0

However, hard carbon has a limited cycle performance owing to the formation of unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). To improve the cycle performance, several studies are underway to find suitable additives. In this study, the effects of fluorocarbon carbonate (FEC) and succinic anhydride (SA) on the life characteristics of hard carbon were investigated and the reasons were examined. All additives negatively affected the cycle performance because they increase film resistance. The high film resistance in the electrolyte with FEC was due to the formation of the SEI layer with the introduction of the sodium fluoride component with a relatively high barrier energy of 3.34 eV. On the other hand, the high film resistance in the electrolyte with SA was due to the formation of a thick formed SEI layer, and the reason of the increase in film resistance of the two additives was different.",33.33333333,"국립수산과학원, 인하대학",National Fisheries Research and Development Institute (NFRDI); Inha University,"국립수산과학원, 인하대학",국립수산과학원; 인하대학,Kim Hayoung; Yoon Seunguk; 챘째혮챙혞혱챘쨈'H.

In this study, 3,429 Express Sequence Tag (EST) sequences were generated from B. rapa cv. Osome cDNA library and the unique transcripts were classified functionally using a gene ontology (GO) hierarchy, Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG). KEGG orthology and the structural domain data were obtained from the biological database for stress related genes (SRG). EST datasets provided a wide outlook of functional characterization of B. rapa cv. Osome. In silico analysis revealed % 83 of ESTs to be well annotated towards reeds one dimensional concept. Clustering of ESTs returned 333 contigs and 2,446 singlets, giving a total of 3,284 putative unigene sequences. This dataset contained 1,017 EST sequences functionally annotated to stress responses and from which expression of randomly selected SRGs were analyzed against cold, salt, drought, ABA, water and PEG stresses. Most of the SRGs showed differentially expression against these stresses. Thus, the EST dataset is very important for discovering the potential genes related to stress resistance in Chinese cabbage, and can be of useful resources for genetic engineering of Brassica sp.",0,"한경대학, 충남대학, 충북대학, 순천대학, 아시아종묘",Hankyong National University; Chungnam National University; Chungbuk National University; Sunchon National University; Asia Seed Ltd.,"한경대학, 충남대학, 충북대학, 순천대학, 아시아종묘",한경대학; 충남대학; 충북대학; 순천대학; 아시아종묘,Senthil Kumar Thamil Arasan; Jong-In Park; Nasar U.

Herein, we report a case of subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma that occurred in the ear pinna of a 19-month-old male Smad3 mouse. On gross examination, the mass extended to the whole ear auricle and obscured the ear opening. The tumor was approximately 10x10 mm in size, ill-circumscribed, and firm with superficial hemorrhage. The cut surface of the mass was grayish-white and solid with focal necrosis and hemorrhage. Histologically, spindle tumor cells with cigar-like nuclei and plump cells with round nuclei formed broad interlacing fascicles. Additionally, the tumor cells invaded adjacent muscles. Immunohistochemically, the tumor sections had positive reactions for desmine and a-SMA and were partially positive for vimentin while negative for S-100 and myogenin. Based on the results of the examination, we diagnosed this case as subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma. 횂짤2014 PVJ.

The current model was carried out to study the spatial mutual interaction of porcine denuded oocytes and granulosa cells either in direct contact (juxtacrine) or paracrine co-culture using transwell system. Transwell 0.4 횓쩌m polyester membrane inserts were used to permit oocytes-granulosa cells paracrine communication with a distance of 2 mm between them in co-culture. Oocytes were cultured with granulosa cells in a defined basic maturation medium for 44 h. In results, oocyte secreted factors (OSFs; GDF9 and BMP15) temporal expression showed progressive decrement by the end of culture in case of direct contact with granulosa cells while it was increased progressively in the paracrine co-culture groups. However, oocytes that were cultured in direct contact showed a significant increase in blastocyst development after parthenogenetic activation than the paracrine co-cultured ones (20% vs. 11.5%, respectively). By the end of culture, granulosa cell count in direct contact showed a significant decrease than the indirect co-culture group (1.2 x 105 cell/mL vs. 2.1 x 10(5) cell/mL, respectively). Steroids (P4 and E2) and steriodogenesis enzymes mRNA levels showed significant temporal alterations either after 22 h and 44 h of IVM in both juxtacrine and paracrine co-culture systems (P '0.05). CX43 was much more highly expressed in the granulosa of the direct contact group than the indirect co-culture group. These results indicate the difference in mutual communication between oocytes and granulosa cells that were cocultured either in direct contact (juxtacrine) or with a short distance (paracrine) and propose a new paradigm to study different ovarian follicular cells interaction.",100,"서울대학, zagaziguniversity",Seoul National University; Zagazig University,"서울대학, ZagazigUniversity",서울대학; ZagazigUniversity,I.

The levels of pork meat (PM) and yellow-fin tuna (YFT) in the test frankfurters were as follows: 100% PM (control), 90% PM+10% YFT (T1), 80% PM+20% YFT (T2), 70% PM+30% YFT (T3), 60% PM+40% YFT (T4), and 50% PM+50% YFT (T5). The pH of the frankfurter batters significantly decreased with increasing tuna levels, because the pH of the tuna is lower than that of the pork. The water holding capacity did not differ significantly in frankfurters containing up to 30% tuna, whereas that of the 40% tuna-containing frankfurter was significantly lower than the control. Cooking loss did not differ significantly. At up to 10% tuna, apparent viscosity did not differ significantly, whereas at 20% tuna, it was significantly lower than the control. Fat separation and total expressible fluid separation at up to 30% tuna did not differ from the control; however, when more than 30% was added, higher losses were observed. The hardness of frankfurters containing more than 40% tuna was lower than that of the control, but there was no significant difference in springiness. The overall acceptability of frankfurters manufactured with up to 30% tuna did not differ significantly from the control.

Irradiated fresh pork slices were prepared by gamma-irradiation at 40 kGy, and inoculated with Salmonella followed by storage at 4 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 35 degrees C up to 240 h, depending on storage temperature. Salmonella cell counts were enumerated on tryptic soy agar during storage. For calculation of maximum specific growth rate (Log CFU/cm(2)/h), lag phase duration (h), lower asymptote (Log CFU/cm(2)), and upper asymptote (Log CFU/cm(2)), the Baranyi model was fitted to the bacterial cell counts. The model parameters were then further expressed as a function of storage temperature (R-2: 0.8-0.992). In addition, a dynamic model was also developed to. predict Salmonella growth at changing temperature. Mathematical indices showed that the model had good performance with 1.011 and 1.04 for bias and accuracy factors, respectively, under constant temperature. In addition, graphical comparison showed that Salmonella growth simulation under changing temperature was acceptable. The results indicate that the developed models should be useful in predicting Salmonella growth in irradiated fresh pork, which could be used for special target groups and immunocompromised patients.",100,한국전자통신연구원,Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute,한국전자통신연구원,한국전자통신연구원,Y.

We found that s.l. immunization with the recombinant sHA1 plus cholera toxin (CT) induced mucosal antibodies as well as systemic antibodies including neutralizing Abs and provided complete protection against infection with pandemic influenza virus A/CA/04/09 (H1N1) in mice. Indeed, the protection efficacy was comparable with that induced by intramuscular (i.m.) immunization route utilized as general administration route of influenza vaccine.

However, since there is no method by which to predict the influenza strain that will cause the next pandemic, the demand to develop new vaccination strategies with broad cross-reactivity against influenza viruses are clearly important. The ectodomain of the influenza M2 protein (M2e) is an attractive target for developing a vaccine with broad cross-reactivity. For these reasons, we investigated the efficacy of an inactivated H9N2 virus vaccine (a-H9N2) mixed with M2e (1xM2e or 4xM2e) proteins expressed in Escherichia coli, which contains the consensus of sequence the extracellular domain of matrix 2 (M2e) of A/chicken/Vietnam/27262/09 (H5N1) avian influenza virus, and investigated its humoral immune response and cross-protection against influenza A viruses. Results: Mice were intramuscularly immunized with a-H9N2, 1xM2e alone, 4xM2e alone, a-H9N2/1xM2e, or a-H9N2/4xM2e. Three weeks post-vaccination, mice were challenged with lethal homologous (A/ chicken /Korea/ma163/04, H9N2) or heterosubtypic virus (A/Philippines/2/82, H3N2 and A/aquatic bird/Korea/maW81/05, H5N2). Our studies demonstrate that the survival of mice immunized with a-H9N2/1xM2e or with a-H9N2/4xM2e (100% survival) was significantly higher than that of mouse-adapted H9N2 virus-infected mice vaccinated with 1xM2e alone or with 4xM2e alone (0% survival). We also evaluated the protective efficacy of the M2e + vaccine against infection with mouse-adapted H5N2 influenza virus. Protection from death in the control group (0% survival) was similar to that of the 1×M2e alone and 4xM2e alone-vaccinated groups (0% survival). Only 40% of mice vaccinated with vaccine alone survived challenge with H5N2, while the a-H9N2/1×M2e and a-H9N2/4×M2e groups showed 80% and 100% survival following mouse-adapted H5N2 challenge, respectively. We also examined cross-protection against human H3N2 virus and found that the a-H9N2/1×M2e group displayed partial cross-protection against H3N2 (40% survival), whereas vaccine alone, 1×M2e alone, 4×M2e alone, or H9N2/1×M2e groups showed incomplete protection (0% survival) in response to challenge with a lethal dose of human H3N2 virus. Conclusions: Taken together, these results suggest that prokaryote-expressed M2e protein improved inactivated H9N2 virus vaccine efficacy and achieved cross-protection against lethal influenza A virus infection in mice.",33.33333333,"서울대학, 한국전자통신연구원",Seoul National University; Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute,"서울대학, 한국전자통신연구원",서울대학; 한국전자통신연구원,Eun-Ha Kim; Jun-Han Lee; P.

In the present study, the induction of apoptosis of cancer cells by deinoxanthin was investigated.   MATERIALS AND METHODS Apoptotic effects were evaluated in HepG2, PC-3, and HT-29 cells, and were measured through cell viability, morphological changes, and a DNA fragmentation assay. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using 5-(and 6-)-carboxy-2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H2DCF-DA). The expression of apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins was assayed by western blotting.   RESULTS The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for deinoxanthin against the HepG2, HT-29, and PC-3 cell lines were 59 횓쩌M, 61 횓쩌M, and 77 횓쩌M, respectively. Deinoxanthin treatment caused an increase in ROS in all tested cells, suggesting possible pro-oxidant activity of deinoxanthin. Pro-caspase-3 was degraded in cancer cells by deinoxanthin treatment. Moreover, BCL2 expression decreased, but that of BAX increased.   CONCLUSION The present findings demonstrate for the first time the novel functional property of deinoxanthin isolated from radioresistant bacteria as a potent inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells. These data suggest that deinoxanthin could be potentially useful as a chemopreventive agent.",100,"한국원자력연구원, 전남대학, 바이오플러스",Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute; Chonnam National University; Bioplus (Co.

In this study, we aimed to identify and rank the importance of clinical indicators that correspond to each pattern. During the fundamental study to standardize and objectify the identification of patterns in traditional Korean medicine (TKM) treatment for stroke (the SOPI-Stroke project), we developed the Third Standardization for Pattern Identification (K-SPI-Stroke-III), which includes 44 clinical indicators that belong to one of the four patterns (Dampness-Phlegm, Fire-Heat, Qi deficiency, and Yin deficiency). Between September 2006 and December 2010, a total of 105 TKM doctors from 11 hospitals performed four examinations on 4,012 subjects based on the clinical indicators in the K-SPI-Stroke-III, and they were asked to leave a special mark on the indicators they thought were important, regardless of the number of the indicators. A total of 1,018 patients were included in the study. Among the 44 clinical indicators of the K-SPI-Stroke-III, four indicators were highly significant in differentiating between patterns and the frequency within a pattern. In contrast, another seven indicators were almost useless. Meanwhile, six confounding indicators had outlying values for differentiating between patterns and the frequency within a pattern. In conclusion, the four significant indicators should be actively considered when identifying patterns for strokes in clinical practice. Regarding the six confounding indicators, a further study should be conducted to modify some parts of the current K-SPI-Stroke-III.",100,한국전자통신연구원,Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute,한국전자통신연구원,한국전자통신연구원,T.

A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2905 patients with stroke in 11 Oriental Medicine hospitals of Korea. Outcome measures comprised patterns decided by TKM doctors considering 44 items and 44 items that were based on inspection, listening and smelling, inquiry, and palpation. Factor analysis was used as statistical method for classifying 44 items, and dominant pattern of the four patterns [Qi deficiency (QD), Fire-heat (FH), Yin deficiency (YD), Dampness-phlegm (DP)] for each factor was determined by Chi-square test. Thirty-three items belonged to some factors, but 11 items did not. 14 factors were extracted. Six factors which had a negative loading were separated, and distinguished using hyphen. The fourteen factors accounted for 9.42%, 6.97%, 5.75%, 4.22%, 4.15%, 3.82%, 3.32%, 3.14%, 2.95%, 2.65%, 2.62%, 2.47%, 2.37% and 2.29% of total variance respectively, and totally 56.14%. In conclusion, there are 10 factors which belong to exclusive pattern, and 9 factors which belong to inter-related pattern. It was statistically found out that there are inter-relation between DP and QD, between DP and FH, between FH and YD, and between YD and QD for stroke patients.",100,"크리스티아니아대학칼리지, 한국한의학연구원, 노르웨이북극대학uit",Kristiania University College; Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine; UiT Norges Arktiske Universitet,"크리스티아니아대학칼리지, 한국한의학연구원, 노르웨이북극대학UiT",크리스티아니아대학칼리지; 한국한의학연구원; 노르웨이대학,B.

When chips selectively activated with PSA were immersed in the gold nanoparticles conjugated with prostatic specific antigens-poly clonal antibodies (PSA-pAb), it was possible to observe changes in the number density and the area ratio of gold nanoparticles on the surface of the chips according to the concentration of PSA with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images. As PSA concentration increased, the number density and the area ratio of gold nanoparticle probes on the surfaces of the chips increased accordingly. Conversely, with lower concentration, the number density and the area ratio of gold nanoparticle probes on the surfaces decreased at a certain ratio. We observed the correlations between PSA concentration and number density, area ratio of gold nanoparticle probes through the analysis of SEM images.

This study was designed to determine the anti-inflammatory and anti-adipogenesis effect of CST and JCST in vitro. CST and JCST of various concentrations were added in RAW 264.7 and 3T3-L1 cell. To determine the anti-inflammatory and anti-adipogenesis effects of CST and JCST, the PGE2 production was measured by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treated RAW 264.7 cell. The adipocytes was determined by Oil red O staining, triglyceride (TG) production, leptin level and the protein expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR횓쨀), CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins alpha (C/EBP횓짹) and fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

METHODS 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were differentiated into adipocytes with or without SCGBT. After differentiation, we measured Oil Red O staining, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity and leptin production. In addition, its effect on scavenging activities of 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) and 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals in in vitro systems.   RESULTS In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, SCGBT significantly inhibited lipid accumulation and triglyceride production, and mediated inactivation of GPDH, a major enzyme in the process of adipogenesis. Consistent with this, SCGBT stimulation significantly decreased the amount of leptin in 3T3-L1 adipose cells. Furthermore, SCGBT enhanced the scavenging activities on ABTS and DPPH radicals. The generation of malondialdehyde (MDA) during low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation was significantly reduced by SCGBT treatment. Of interest, SCGBT extract inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Our aim was to investigate the protective effect of an aqueous extract of Dendrobium nobile Lindl (DNE) against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI). Quantification of four phenolic acids (4-hydroxybenzoic, vanillic, syringic, and ferulic acid) in DNE was determined using the HPLC-photodiode array method. Possible protective effects against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity were investigated using in-vitro (porcine kidney cells; PK15) and in-vivo (Sprague Dawley rat) studies. Among the four phenolic acids, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid was the most abundant. In the in-vitro study, DNE pretreatment partially prevented decrement of viability after cisplatin (15 횓쩌g/mL) treatment in the both the MTT and crystal violet assays. Moreover, relative to cells treated with cisplatin alone, the DNE (50 횓쩌g/mL)-pretreated cells showed a ~30% increase in glutathione levels and a ~15% decrease in reactive oxygen species. The expression of p53 was also decreased in DNE-pretreated cells (p < 0.05). In the in-vivo study, the renal function index decreased to normal levels in groups pretreated with DNE (300 and 500 mg/kg); histopathological alterations and apoptotic cells were also attenuated. Moreover, DNE pretreatment ameliorated oxidative stress in the kidney, as evidenced by recovered antioxidant enzyme levels and decreased lipid peroxidation. DNE, by decreasing oxidative stress, was found to have a protective effect against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

However, general CBCT images have a limitation in that they cannot perfectly perform a sophisticated registration. On the other hand, the SymmetryTM 4D image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) system of Elekta offers a 4D CBCT registration option. In this study, we evaluated the usefulness of SymmetryTM.Method and Materials: Planning CT images of the CIRS moving lung phantom were acquired 4D multi-detector CT (MDCT), and the images were sorted as 10 phases from 0% phase to 90% phase. The thickness of the CT images was 1 mm. Acquired MDCT images were transferred to the contouring software, and a virtual target was generated. A one-arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan was performed by using the treatment planning system on the virtual target. Finally, the movement of the phantom was verified by using the XVI SymmetryTM system.Results: The physical movement of the CIRS moving lung phantom was ±10.0 mm in the superiorinferior direction, ±1.0 mm in the lateral direction, and ±2.5 mm in the anterior-posterior direction. The movement of the phantom was measured from the 4D MDCT registration as ±10.2 mm in the superior-inferior direction, ±0.9 mm in the lateral direction, and ±2.45 mm in the anterior-posterior direction. The movement of the phantom was measured from the SymmetryTM registration as ±10.1 mm in the superior-inferior direction, ±0.9 mm in the lateral direction, and ±2.4 mm in the anterior-posterior direction.Conclusion: We confirmed that 4D CBCT is a beneficial tool for the treatment of movable tumors, and that the 4D registration of SymmetryTM can increase the precision of the registration when a movable tumor is the target of radiation treatment.",100,"한국과학기술원, 한국기계연구원",Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology; Korea Institute of Machinery & Materials,"한국과학기술원, 한국기계연구원",한국과학기술원; 한국기계연구원,Hun-Joo Shin; Shin-Wook Kim; C.

One-vs-rest (OVR) is one of the most widely used approaches for multiclass classification due to its simplicity and excellent performance. However, many confusing classes in such applications will degrade its results. For example, hand clap and boxing are two confusing actions. Hand clap is easily misclassified as boxing, and vice versa. Therefore, precisely classifying confusing classes remains a challenging task. To obtain better performance for multiclass classifications that have confusing classes, we first develop a classifier chain model for multiclass classification (CCMC) to transfer class information between classifiers. Then, based on an analysis of our proposed model, we propose an easy-to-hard learning paradigm for multiclass classification to automatically identify easy and hard classes and then use the predictions from simpler classes to help solve harder classes. Similar to CCMC, the classifier chain (CC) model is also proposed by Read et al. (2009) to capture the label dependency for multi-label classification. However, CC does not consider the order of di_culty of the labels and achieves degenerated performance when there are many confusing labels. Therefore, it is non-trivial to learn the appropriate label order for CC. Motivated by our analysis for CCMC, we also propose the easy-to-hard learning paradigm for multi-label classification to automatically identify easy and hard labels, and then use the predictions from simpler labels to help solve harder labels. We also demonstrate that our proposed strategy can be successfully applied to a wide range of applications, such as ordinal classification and relationship prediction. Extensive empirical studies validate our analysis and the efiectiveness of our proposed easy-to-hard learning strategies.",100,"울산과학기술원, universityofcalifornia, 서울대학","Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology; University of California, Berkeley; Seoul National University","울산과학기술원, UniversityofCalifornia, 서울대학",울산과학기술원; UniversityofCalifornia; 서울대학,Weiwei Liu; I.

We construct a local mobility network using data on urban bus services to estimate local-scale movement of people. We also construct a national mobility network from orientation-destination data of vehicular traffic between highway tollgates to evaluate national-scale movement of people. A metapopulation model is used to simulate the spread of epidemics. Thus, the number of infected people is simulated using a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model within the administrative division, and inter-division spread of infected people is determined through local and national mobility networks. In this paper, we consider two scenarios for epidemic spread. In the first, the infectious disease only spreads through local-scale movement of people, that is, the local mobility network. In the second, it spreads via both local and national mobility networks. For the former, the simulation results show infected people sequentially spread to neighboring divisions. Yet for the latter, we observe a faster spreading pattern to distant divisions.

To improve its fracture toughness, the approach commonly utilized has been the addition of a second phase to form a composite and produce nanostructured materials. The purpose of this study was to produce a mechanical synthesis of CoZr and ZrO2 nanopowders from CoO and Zr powders, and fabricate dense nanocrystalline 2CoZr-ZrO2 composites within two minutes using this pulsed current activated sintering method. Their mechanical properties, biocompatibility and microstructure were then evaluated. Nanopowders of CoZr and ZrO2 were synthesized mechanochemically according to the reaction (2 CoO + 3 Zr → 2CoZr + ZrO2) from CoO and Zr powders by high-energy ball milling. The synthesized powders were consolidated by the pulsed current activated sintering method within two minutes under 80Mpa pressure. CoZr and ZrO2 composite was sintered by the rapid heating of the nanophase. The hardness and fracture toughness of the 2 CoZr-ZrO2 composite in this study were better than the hardness of monolithic CoZr and the fracture toughness of a monolithic ZrO2. Additionally, the 2 CoZr-ZrO2 composite exhibited good biocompatibility. †(Received January 18, 2017; Accepted February 18, 2017)",50,"한국과학기술연구원, 고려대학",Korea Institute of Science and Technology; Korea University,"한국과학기술연구원, 고려대학",한국과학기술연구원; 고려대학,I.

One of the characteristics of thermal insulation coatings is their low thermal conductivity, and, materials such as YSZ (Yttria-stabilized zirconia), which have low thermal conductivity, are used for this purpose. This research presents a study of the changes in the microstructure and thermal conductivity of 8YSZ/SiO2 multi compositional thermal insulation coating for different compositions, and particle size distributions of suspension, when it is subjected to suspension plasma spraying. To obtain a porous coating structure, the mixing ratio of 8YSZ and SiO2 particles and the particle sizes of the SiO2 were changed. The microstructure, phase formation behavior, porosity and thermal conductivity of the coatings were analyzed. The porosities were found to be 1.2-32.1%, and the thermal conductivities of the coatings were 0.797-0.369 W/mK.

However, the image performance indexes such as image count, scatter fraction (SF), spatial resolution (SR) obtained using a conventional gamma camera, which uses a 3/8-in sodium iodide scintillator, are poor mainly due to its low detection efficiency. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using a higher energy peak (637 and 723 keV) for the energy window to obtain a better imaging performance compared with the conventional I-131 imaging method. GATE (v7.0), which is based on Monte Carlo method, was used for performing simulations. A clinical gamma camera, SYMBIA-T2 (Siemens), was mounted on a NaI scintillator in the simulation. A GAGG scintillator was also realized for effective detection of high energy gamma, in addition to using high energy (HE) and ultrahigh energy (UHE) collimators. We obtained I-131 planar images through the conventionally used window method (364 keV 횂짹 10%). The high-energy gamma ray of I 131 (637 and 723 keV) have been additionally used for improving image performance. The scatter correction method was applied to images for suppressing scatter due to high-energy gamma rays. Various indexes are used for validating image performance such as SR, SF, and contrast-to-noise ratio. High-energy gamma rays could be used to increase the image counts, but the other image performances were degraded compared to the scatter-corrected 364 keV images (SF of 6.33 - 27.73%; SR of 0.93 - 6.02%). The UHE collimator was useful in obtaining a better spatial resolution and suppressing scatter components compared with the HE collimator. However, it did not exhibit a sufficient image performance to be considered as a replacement for the HE collimator. In order to use the high-energy gamma rays of I-131 (637 and 723 keV), it is necessary to design a new collimator to control penetration and improve resolution, instead of using a UHE collimator. Furthermore, scatter correction methods also need to be optimized.",100,"방위개발청, 부산대학",Agency for Defense Development; Pusan National University,"방위개발청, 부산대학",방위개발청; 부산대학,Min-Hwan Kim; J. Bae; B.

We propose a novel method that performs fully automatic registration between a cone-beam CT image and an optically scanned model. To build a robust and automatic initial registration method, our method applies deep-pose regression neural networks in a reduced domain (i.e., 2-dimensional image). Subsequently, fine registration is performed via optimal clusters. Majority voting system achieves globally optimal transformations while each cluster attempts to optimize local transformation parameters. The coherency of clusters determines their candidacy for the optimal cluster set. The outlying regions in the iso-surface are effectively removed based on the consensus among the optimal clusters. The accuracy of registration was evaluated by the Euclidean distance of 10 landmarks on a scanned model which were annotated by the experts in the field. The experiments show that the proposed method's registration accuracy, measured in landmark distance, outperforms other existing methods by 30.77% to 70%. In addition to achieving high accuracy, our proposed method requires neither human-interactions nor priors (e.g., iso-surface extraction). The main significance of our study is twofold: 1) the employment of light-weighted neural networks which indicates the applicability of neural network in extracting pose cues that can be easily obtained and 2) the introduction of an optimal cluster-based registration method that can avoid metal artifacts during the matching procedures.",100,"컴퓨터과학및공학부, 서울대학치과대학, 하버드존a폴슨공학및응용과학대학원, 숭실대학, 삼성전기",Department of Computer Science and Engineering; Seoul National University School of Dentistry; Harvard John A.
